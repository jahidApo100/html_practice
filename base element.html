    <p><img src="images/stickman.gif" alt="stickman" width="30" height="38"></a> - Notice that we have only specified a relative address for the image. Since we have specified a base URL in the head section, the browser will look for the image at "https://www.w3schools.com/images/stickman.gif".</p>

    <p><a href="tags/tag_base.asp">Html base tag</a>- Notice that the link opens in a new window, even if it has no target="_blank" attribute. This is because the target attribute of the base element is set to "_blank".</p>
